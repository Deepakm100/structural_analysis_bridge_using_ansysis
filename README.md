# Structural Analysis Of Bridge Using ANSYS

## Overview
This project involves the structural analysis and simulation of bridge structures using ANSYS software. The objective was to evaluate the structural integrity, stress distribution, and performance under various loading conditions.

## Features
- **Structural Analysis:** Utilized ANSYS to simulate and analyze the behavior of bridge components.
- **Stress Testing:** Applied loads and boundary conditions to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Optimization:** Identified critical stress points and proposed design optimizations based on simulation results.

## Methodology
1. **Model Setup:** Created 3D models of bridge structures in ANSYS Workbench.
2. **Material Properties:** Defined material properties and section profiles for bridge elements.
3. **Load Application:** Applied various load cases including dead loads, live loads, and environmental loads.
4. **Analysis:** Ran simulations to calculate stress distribution, deformation, and factor of safety.
5. **Results Interpretation:** Analyzed simulation results to assess structural performance and identify areas for improvement.
